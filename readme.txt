You are reading the documentation for Etude 7: Graphical User Interface.
The purpose of this etude was to learn how to develop a GUI and use it to
explain a data structure studied in 200 level computer science.

We chose to develop a GUI for a binary search tree.

Our submission is a python program comprised of two files:
gui.py
binary_tree.py

We decided on python because we wanted to use tkinter to draw the
GUI. The reason we split the program into two files was so we could
use one file to focus on the BST data structre while the other is
used to focus on the graphic design components.

_________________________HOW TO USE_____________________________________

Navigate to the directory containing the .py files and use the
following command in terminal to run the program:

$ python3 gui.py

Using the GUI is quite simple as each entry box and button has
corresponding labels so the user can identify what everything does.

The textbox along the bottom of the GUI serves to display any
information to the user regarding specific features of the BST in
action.

_______________________PROCEDURE____________________________________

How the program functions:

The GUI part of the program has been built upon a binary search tree
data structure, which is all contained in the binary_tree.py file.

Each of the functions (search, insert, delete, traversals) are tied
to the BST data structure.

All of the operations and traversals are explained in the GUI.

__________________________TESTING_____________________________________

The program has been extensively tested, we have given the program
to our peers and mentors in an attempt to break it.

At this point upon submitting, the program is quite robust and
we haven't had any crashes.

__________________________CONTRIBUTIONS______________________________

Ben worked heavily on implementing the data structure and making
entries & buttons work as they should.
Josef worked on the front end side of things, manipulating
to make the program look half decent.
